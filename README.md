# PowerShell Shellcode Loader

This project demonstrates a simple PowerShell script that:
- Downloads a raw shellcode binary from a remote server
- Allocates executable memory in the current process
- Copies the shellcode into memory
- Sets memory protection to executable
- Executes the shellcode using a managed delegate

## üîß How It Works

The script follows these steps:

1. **Download** the shellcode from a remote URL using `System.Net.WebClient`.
2. **Allocate** memory in the process using `Marshal.AllocHGlobal`.
3. **Copy** the bytes of the shellcode into the allocated memory.
4. **Change** the memory protection to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE (0x40)` using `VirtualProtect`.
5. **Create** a delegate pointing to the shellcode location and execute it.
